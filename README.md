## About
I am a Computer Science student passionate about technology, innovation, and mobile app development. Currently in my second year at university, I focus on enhancing my problem-solving skills and learning Android development, specifically using Kotlin.

I am also currently working as a mentor at SVU University, where I guide students who are building their problem-solving skills. This role allows me to share my knowledge and help others grow in the field.

Additionally, I have participated in the ECPC qualifications (Egyptian Collegiate Programming Contest) with my teammates, which helped us strengthen our collaborative and competitive programming skills.

Beyond academics, I actively engage with the tech community, collaborating on projects and exchanging ideas, which further fuels my passion for software development and continuous learning.
